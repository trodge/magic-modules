in mmv1/api/resource.go make the TGCResource struct a superset of the Resource struct and make all methods that use TGCResource fields use it as the receiever type. Do not make any unrelated changes

why did you think SetDefault should use TGCResource?

move all the TGCResource related code to a file called tgc_resource.go in the same directory and package

why is the TGCResource struct definition still in resource.go?

check again for TGCResource related code in resource.go
